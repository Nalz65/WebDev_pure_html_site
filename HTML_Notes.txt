HTML TABLES: 

You can use a table to create a padding effect using just HTML.

It helps structure the data.

You can declare Header, body and footer
- In header you can add titles
- Body has content

Why you need thead and tbody and tfoot, we may format different for each section

There is no styling or format applied when using Table element
